Content-Container(e2,e1)
Comment: Even if a "kitchen" is more a location than a container, in this case we can interpret that "salt" is stored there, probably in the "kitchen" cabinets. (See 112.)

Other
Comment: The relation is a causal one, but food is a concrete substance and cannot be an Effect, while work is an event and cannot be a Producer.
